# Some quick commands to get a Gatsby site going.
# This is assuming you've already installed node.
sudo npm i -g gatsby 				# Version 1.9.277 Stable, can run gatsby develop
#sudo npm install --global gatsby-cli@next	# Install Gatsby
gatsby new <site name> 				# Generate your website
# After you cd into your new site you might see some security errors
# You actually don't want to try to fix these, just check for the next release
sudo npm install --global gatsby-cli@next

cd <site name> 					# go into your new site folder
gatsby develop					# start the development server
npm i gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-plugin-catch-links
gatsby build

#***********************************************#
# When adding gatsby on your server make sure   #
# you have at least 1GB of swap space or it     #
# won't work. Also use the following command to #
# handle pathPrefixes. Maybe write a script to  #
# generate this easily. Do this in react too.   #
#***********************************************#

# In gastby-config.js
module.exports = {
  // Note: it must *not* have a trailing slash.
  pathPrefix: `/<prefix>`,
};

# On build run
gatsby build --prefix-paths
