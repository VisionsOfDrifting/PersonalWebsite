    <p>A little bit more about me.</p>
    <p>
      I grew up in the foothills of Los Angeles. I went to Glendale Community
      College before transfering to UC, Santa Cruz. I have a love for the beach
      and a passion for technology.

      {' '}
      I've had an interest in technology all my life. In college I spent most of
      my free time learning about different programming languages, tech stacks,
      and machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I took my first class in Software Engineering I had my first chance
      to put the things I'd read about into practice. In that class I completed
      my first fullstack project with a team. The project was a CRUD application
      we created with a LAMP stack. Looking back at the original source code
      there's a lot that could be done differently, but I'm still proud of what
      my team and I were able to acomplish in 5 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that first project I've learned a considerable ammount and have
      completed other projects on various stacks. If you'd like to see live
      demos of my completed work check out my portfolio there's a link to the
      source code hosted on github as well.
