    <p>A little bit more about me.</p>
    <p>
      I grew up in the foothills of Los Angeles. I have a love for the beach and
      a passion for technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      {' '}
      I've had an interest in technology all my life. In college I spent most of
      my free time learning about different programming languages, tech stacks,
      and machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>Education goes here</p>
    <p>Possibly do a skills section</p>
    {/* <p>
      When I took my first class in Software Engineering I had my first chance
      to put the things I'd read about into practice. In that class I completed
      my first fullstack project with a team. The project was a CRUD application
      we created with a LAMP stack. Looking back at the original source code
      there's a lot that could be done differently, but I'm still proud of what
      my team and I were able to acomplish in 5 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that first project I've learned a considerable ammount and have
      completed other projects on various stacks. If you'd like to see live
      demos of my completed work check out my portfolio there's a link to the
      source code hosted on github as well.
    </p>
    <h3>My thoughts about tech today</h3>
    <p>
      The next technologies I've been eyeing are React Native and Flutter. I
      think that hybrid app Frameworks are important tools that are going to
      become widespread in the next few years as they update the technology.
